<h1>AWS developer course examples</h1>


Here you can find a few examples that may be useful when teaching the Dev course. They're mostly implemented in the form 
of jUnit tests but actually they don't relay heavily into asserting conditions. 

DynamoDBTest demostrates how to use the DynamoDB high level API, among other things.
S3Test includes a multiupload demo using the TransferManager.
SMSTest will help you to show how to send mail using AWS and the javax.mail API.

Feel free to use the code. And of course, all improvements will be appreciated!
